# D_FDRI
D-FDRI (Differential Fourier Domain Regularized Inversion) - an efficient, fast, single-step reconstruction method for single-pixel imaging (DOI: 10.1364/OE.433199)

This is a pre-release. The Python module is in the file dfdri.py, while example.py is an example showing how to use it for generating binary patterns to be used with SPI, as well as how to reconstruct the image from a compressive measurement. The measurement and reconstruction matrices may be easily saved and used with other software, sucha as Matlab, afterwards. Further examples and documentation will be included soon.
